# bikesharing

#### Overview
Bikeshare services are growing in popularity in New York City as commuters look for quick and convenient transportation methods. The purpose of this analysis, then, is to use the available data for NYC to show that, given the nature of traffic in large cities, there is similar demand to be met in Des Moines, Iowa. Specifically, we are looking for investors to help launch a bikesharing service in a new area. The data and graphics can be used to determine which demographics may be most interested in using such a service.

#### Results
Time for the start of each ride that ended during the week. This graphic shows that most users are likely using bikesharing for their daily commutes.

Overall start time of each ride, showing the hours of peak usage. Although most rides begin at the morning and evening times for normal business hours, there is still significant usage outside of these hours as well. The only hours without significant usage tend to be between from 11:00 PM to 05:00 AM, after which point usage increases again.

Breakdown of users by gender. It is clear from the graphic that most users are male. This could be an important factor in target demographics for marketing or bike design.

This shows the frequency of rides for each gender by user status. Most rides are by males who subscribe to the bikesharing service, rather than those who only use the service irregularly.

Almost all rides are under an hour in duration. That is, each bike is usually checked out for less than 30 minutes.

Regardless of gender, checkout times tend to be relatively short, with the great majority being less than 30 minutes in duration.

It appears that a small number of bikes are ridden most frequently. Tracking which bikes are used most often may be a way to predict which will require the most maintenance.

#### Summary
From the data provided, most riders appear to be subscribers who use the bikeshare service for their quotidian commutes to and from work. While most of these subscribers are male, there is still a significant number of users who are not male. Furthermore, while most riders who use the service subscribe, there are also many who only need it occasionally. Thus, a new bikeshare service should be able to accommodate these users as well. 

#### Further Research
While this data is good to know and useful for preparing to launch a bikesharing service, there are still many questions that investors will have. Theft and damages are significant concerns, as these will directly translate to costs for the company. It will be important to study such consequences and ensure that measures are taken to minimize theft and damages. Another question that investors are likely to ask is whether there is any demand for a bikesharing service. If there is no existing bicycle infrastructure, people may be less likely to subscribe to such a service. Further, it must also be convenient with pick-up and drop-off locations. If the process for using a bikesharing service is too complicated, or takes too long, there will be fewer people who make use of it.
